Hi, I am Kaleb, a graduate from 4Geeks Academy! I am a headtsrong indiviual with a love for technology, who is ambitious about maintaing, upadating, and creating new software! My main focus right now is learning the deeper intricacies of Pyhton so I can further hone my skills within the language (which I prefer). That goes to say that I am more than willing to work on backend projects, which will not only help achieve my goal but will build new lasting friendships; so feel free to reach out to me any time!
